# Tron Pixel Contract


## WHAT IS TRONPIXEL?

TronPixel is a collaborative artwork based on the TRON blockchain. You may use the toolbar to paint pixels by purchasing with TRON(TRX) tokens.
 HOW DO I PLAY?
1, first, you will need a TRON Chrome wallet, please click here to download: TronLink https://goo.gl/Yb4NRU (if you cannot visit Google play store, you may click the link below to download with a user guidehttps://s3.amazonaws.com/trondice/Chromewallet/TRONlink.zip
2, click to sign in and bind with your TronLink wallet. 
3, select the toolbar to paint on the canvas (you may choose 15 colors or use the eraser to delete a certain pixel), and make your order in the shopping cart.

## HOW TO EARN TRX?

TronPixel provides a number of ways to earn profit: Profit Sharing, Sales Profit, Jackpot, and Referrals. Every pixel has an independent price, starting with 20 TRX, all first-time pixel payments will enter the “Contract Proceeds”.
 HOW ARE CONTRACT PROCEEDS DISTRIBUTED?
55% allocated to the Profit Sharing: 
10% allocated to Jackpot;
5% paid as Referral Reward;
20% to developer team;
10% to operation team.

## HOW TO EARN SALES PROFIT?

Every pixel starts with 20 TRX, which can be purchased by the next Player with 1.35 times the original price. Hence, the original buyer gets his payment back, while 75% of the 35% price gap goes to the original owner as profit, and 25% goes to the Contract Proceeds.

## HOW DOES THE PROFIT SHARING WORK?

Every pixel you own is counted as your share of the Profit Sharing pool. The more pixels you buy and own, the more share you get. Your profit will accumulate in real time in the game, the more share you have, the more profit you can earn. Once your pixel is bought by someone else, you will lose your share of that pixel, but you will not lose the profit you already earned. The profit will be added to your account balance, funds will be available for withdrawal after the Activation Threshold is met.

## WHO CAN WIN THE JACKPOT?

After the Activation Threshold is met, if the total value do not increase by 10,000 TRX in 24 hours, the last user to purchase a pixel will receive the entire Jackpot. If 24 hours transactions exceed 10,000 TRX, the clock will continue ticking. 
After this, the game will keep going with a different Contract Proceeds distribution rule: 
65% - Profit Sharing 
5% - Referral Reward 
20% - Developer team 
10% - Operation team

## HOW DO I EARN REFERRAL REWARD?

If you're logged in with TronLink and have painted at least one pixel, you'll be able to use your referral link. Any purchases made from this link will earn you a Referral Reward It will be available for withdrawal after the Activation Threshold is met.
 HOW DOES THE ACTIVATION THRESHOLD WORK?
There is a Activation Threshold of 80,000 pixels, which means the withdrawal is locked before 80,000 pixels are purchased. After the threshold is met, all players will be able to withdraw funds from their account balance, and the Jackpot becomes activated.

## WILL GAS FEES BE REQUIRED?

Every time a transaction is made, energy (cpu) will be consumed other than the pixel price. Energy can be accessed by freezing TRX. Initially, the operation team will freeze 1 million TRX to give early adopters energy. After these energy is used up, users will need to get their own energy. How to get Energy: Visithttps://tronscan.org/sign in to your wallet on the right top corner and click "Account". Scroll down and find "Freeze" button. Make sure to choose "Freeze TRX to gain energy".

## WHAT IS HEATMAP AND HOW CAN IT HELP ME?

The heatmap reflects the areas where trading is most active at the moment. Pixels bought in active areas are more likely to be sold. As the number of transactions in an area increases, the color changes from blue to red. Multiple red areas may appear on the canvas at the same time. There are two factors influencing the heatmap: pixel density and latest trading time.
